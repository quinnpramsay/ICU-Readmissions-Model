# AI Final Project
This repository is to track the progress and building of our final project for Artificial Intelligence. Our project is based on 30 Day ICU readmission rates and building a model to help lower that current issue. 

# Proposal
Our idea is to create a machine learning model that predicts 30-day ICU readmission risk for patients over 18, using public datasets like MIMIC and PhysioNet. We’ll use different types of information from these datasets, like labs, vitals, demographics, clinical notes, and X-ray scans. The goal is to show how tabular, text, and image data can be combined for a real-world healthcare problem that has both clinical and economic impact.

We’ll mainly use the MIMIC-IV dataset along with other data from PhysioNet, and we also want to look at different clinical trials and existing models to help improve our approach. On top of that, we’ll bring in Bio_ClinicalBERT from Kaggle. Even though we don’t have access to every kind of medical record, we think we can still build a strong model with the resources available.

Since both of us are focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we think this project is a great way to practice and grow our skills. ICU readmissions are expensive and harmful for patients, so this project also shows how machine learning can improve predictions while touching on important ideas like clinical usefulness, data ethics, and explainability.
